LeetCode Daily Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Challenges repository! ðŸš€

I am actively solving LeetCode problems in Java and committing my solutions on a daily basis to this repository. This practice helps me improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

leetcode-daily/
  |-- solutions/
  |     |-- <problem-name-or-id>/
  |            |-- solution.java
  |            |-- README.md (optional description of the problem)
  |
  |-- README.md (this file)

Folder Structure

Each problem has its own folder named after the problem's title or ID.

Inside each folder, you will find the solution file and optionally a README.md with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach used.

Programming Language Used

I use Java exclusively for solving problems in this repository.

How to Run the Solutions

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/leetcode-daily.git

Navigate to the desired problem's directory:

cd leetcode-daily/solutions/<problem-name-or-id>

Compile and run the solution:

javac solution.java && java Solution

Goals

Solve at least one LeetCode problem daily.

Cover a variety of topics, including:

Arrays

Strings

Dynamic Programming

Graphs

Trees

Algorithms and Data Structures
