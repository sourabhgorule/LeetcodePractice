# LeetCode Daily Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Challenges repository! ðŸš€

I am actively solving LeetCode problems in **Java** and committing my solutions on a daily basis to this repository. This practice helps me improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode-daily/
  |-- solution.java
  |-- README.md (this file)
```

### Folder Structure
- Each problem has its own folder named after the problem's title or ID.
- Inside each folder, you will find the solution file and optionally a README.md with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach used.

## Programming Language Used

I use **Java** exclusively for solving problems in this repository.

## How to Run the Solutions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sourabhgorule/LeetcodePractice.git
   ```

## Goals

- Solve at least one LeetCode problem daily.
- Cover a variety of topics, including:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graphs
  - Trees
  - Algorithms and Data Structures
